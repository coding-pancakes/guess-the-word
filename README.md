# Guess The Word 🧩

## About This Project:
🎲 A guessing game where you have 10 attempts to guess a word chosen randomly from a long list of words. It works by prompting the user to guess one letter at a time. Built using Python.

## How I Built It:
👩🏻‍💻 I used the random module to select a word from a large word bank. Then I used input() to prompt the user to start guessing letters. Finally, I created a while loop that allows 10 attempts at guessing and ends if the word is guessed correctly or all attempts are used.
